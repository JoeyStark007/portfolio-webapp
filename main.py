    Hi, My name is Joseph Tefera. I am an aspiring python programmer. I am a Financial Technology
    major in VCU minoring in Math and Statistics looking to graduate in May 2023. My IT learning began
    in high school from my coding classes but began to sprout when I started to compete in hackathons
    hosted at my college and at Virginia Tech. I have worked for JB Hunt Logistics as well as 
    Major Leage Hacking fellowship. I still have a lot to learn and I look forward to it.
